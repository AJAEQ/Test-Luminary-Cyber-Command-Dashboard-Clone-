#### Brief explanation of 5 major technical decisions.


1. Hosted on Netlify for fast, scalable, and low maintenance deployment.
2. Static site and CDN for global speed, reliability, and improved security.
3. Optional serverless or edge functions to handle dynamic behavior like user progress or API calls.
4. Git based CI/CD for automated builds and seamless updates.
5. Lean architecture minimizing backend complexity while supporting responsive UI and moderate user interaction.
